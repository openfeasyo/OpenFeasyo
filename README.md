# OpenFeasyo
OpenFeasyo is a software platform for physical rehabilitation combining state-of-the-art (mostly low cost) motion sensors and various serious games.

The main goal is that our serious games:
* are configurable and adaptable to patient’s needs
* support multiple input devices (accelerometers, 3D cameras, balance boards, EMG sensors) and their use at the same time
<!--- * can be configured while playing, either directly or from second screen application -->

Play our game [Ghostly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.vub.etro.ghostlyandroid) using touch or [EMG sensors](https://www.delsys.com/trigno/). More games and features are coming soon.
