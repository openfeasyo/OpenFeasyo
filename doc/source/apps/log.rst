OpenFeasyo Log
==============

The OpenFeasyo Log application provides an overview of gaming sessions (only for OpenFeasyo games). The application reads the stored gaming logs (stored in the .c3d file format) and generates a gaming report containing the details about the gaming session like time, date, level details as well as visualization of the sensory data (e.g. EMG plots).
